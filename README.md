### 4. **TUTOR-GUIDE.md**
Instructions for how to interact with your AI tutor (me!) during conversational lessons.

## 🚀 How to Use This System

### Step 1: Understand the Structure
Read through `CURRICULUM.md` to see the complete roadmap. Don't be overwhelmed - we'll take it one topic at a time!

### Step 2: Start with Topic 1
Open the first topic folder: `01-Fundamentals/01-complexity-analysis/`

Each topic contains a detailed `lesson.md` file with:
- **Overview** - What you'll learn and why it matters
- **Prerequisites** - What you should know first
- **Theory & Concepts** - Detailed explanations with analogies
- **Visual Diagrams** - ASCII art and mermaid diagrams
- **JavaScript Implementation** - Complete, commented code examples
- **Step-by-Step Walkthrough** - Line-by-line explanations
- **Complexity Analysis** - Time and space complexity breakdown
- **Common Patterns** - When to use this technique
- **Practice Problems** - Easy, Medium, Hard problems with LeetCode links
- **Common Pitfalls** - Mistakes to avoid
- **Interview Tips** - What interviewers look for
- **Summary & Key Takeaways** - Quick reference
- **Next Steps** - What to study next

### Step 3: Study the Lesson
- Read through the entire lesson file
- Study the diagrams and visualizations
- Understand the code implementations
- Run through the examples mentally or in a code editor

### Step 4: Chat with Your Tutor
Start a conversation with me (your AI tutor) when you need to:
- **Get clarification**: "Can you explain how the two-pointer technique works in more detail?"
- **See more examples**: "Show me another example of sliding window with a different problem"
- **Request practice**: "Give me 5 medium-level practice problems for arrays"
- **Move forward**: "I'm ready for the next topic"
- **Review**: "Can you summarize the key points of complexity analysis?"

### Step 5: Practice
- Work through the practice problems listed in each lesson
- Start with Easy, move to Medium, then Hard
- Try to solve without looking at solutions first
- If stuck after 30 minutes, review the concepts and try again

### Step 6: Mark Complete
Once you've:
- Understood all concepts in the lesson
- Can explain the technique to someone else
- Solved at least 2-3 practice problems

Then update `PROGRESS.md` by checking off that topic!

### Step 7: Move to Next Topic
The system is designed to be linear - each topic builds on previous ones. Follow the order in the curriculum for best results.

## 💬 Conversational Learning

This system combines **written materials** with **conversational tutoring**. You can:

1. **Study independently** using the markdown files
2. **Ask me questions** anytime you need clarification
3. **Request additional content** if you want deeper dives
4. **Get personalized explanations** when concepts are unclear
5. **Discuss approaches** to solving problems

### Example Interactions

```
You: "I don't understand how Big O notation handles nested loops"
Tutor: [Provides detailed explanation with examples]

You: "Show me how to implement a sliding window for finding max sum subarray"
Tutor: [Walks through implementation step-by-step]

You: "I'm ready to move to the next topic"
Tutor: [Checks your progress, suggests next topic, prepares you for what's coming]

You: "Give me 3 hard problems on binary trees"
Tutor: [Provides curated problems with hints]
```

## 📊 Tracking Progress

Your `PROGRESS.md` file shows:
- ✅ Completed topics
- 🔄 Current topic
- ⏳ Pending topics
- 📈 Overall completion percentage
- ⏱️ Estimated time remaining

Update it regularly to stay motivated and see your progress!

## 🎯 Learning Philosophy

### Linear Progression
Topics are ordered so each builds on the previous. Don't skip ahead unless you're already solid on prerequisites.

### Depth Over Speed
It's better to deeply understand 10 topics than to superficially cover 50. Take your time.

### Practice, Practice, Practice
Reading isn't enough. You must code. Aim for at least 3-5 problems per topic.

### Teach to Learn
Try explaining each concept to someone (or to a rubber duck). If you can teach it, you know it.

### Review Regularly
Revisit previous topics every 2-3 weeks to maintain retention.

## 📅 Recommended Study Schedule

### Option 1: Intensive (3-4 months)
- **Daily commitment**: 3-4 hours
- **Pace**: 2-3 topics per week
- **Best for**: Full-time students or interview prep with a deadline

### Option 2: Balanced (5-6 months)
- **Daily commitment**: 2 hours
- **Pace**: 1-2 topics per week
- **Best for**: Working professionals with consistent time

### Option 3: Steady (8-10 months)
- **Daily commitment**: 1 hour
- **Pace**: 1 topic per week
- **Best for**: Long-term learning, building strong foundations

## 🏆 Success Metrics

You'll know you're ready for interviews when you can:
- ✅ Solve Easy problems in under 15 minutes
- ✅ Solve Medium problems in under 30 minutes
- ✅ Approach Hard problems with a clear strategy
- ✅ Explain your solution's time and space complexity
- ✅ Discuss tradeoffs between different approaches
- ✅ Write clean, bug-free code on the first try (most of the time)

## 🆘 Getting Help

### From Your Tutor (Me!)
Simply start a conversation and ask anything:
- "I don't understand X"
- "Can you explain Y differently?"
- "Show me more examples of Z"
- "What's the best way to approach this problem?"

### From the Materials
- Check the **Common Pitfalls** section if you're making mistakes
- Review the **Theory & Concepts** section if fundamentals are unclear
- Study the **Visual Diagrams** for spatial understanding
- Read **Interview Tips** for practical advice
